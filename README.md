# To-Do application
This is a simple To-Do application built using ReactJS. It allows users to add, view, and delete tasks.

--> Features:
1. Add tasks: Users can input a task and add it to the list.
2. View tasks: All added tasks are displayed in a list format.
3. Delete tasks: Each task has a delete button to remove it from the list.


And to run the application locally, u have to follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies
4. Start the development server
5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Or else I am attaching the deployed link in the form itself so, u can visit directly from there also.
